    The effect of global warming is mostly from the overuse of burning fossil fuels to provide the world’s energy needs. To lessen
    the effects of climate change, renewable energy sources such as solar power need to be built. While solar panels do generally
    seem environmentally friendly at first glance during their operation, this is not always the case when we look at the full cycle
    of its production. Mining the raw materials needed can induce some problems. The manufacturing process is energy intensive and 
    toxic. A large amount of land is needed, which may impact wildlife and there are issues with the disposal and recycling of solar 
    panels. However, many of these issues can be reduced through careful thinking and proper preparations.

    Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from undernutrition, 
    malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone (World Health Organisation, 2023). To combat the effects of global warming, the world 
    must use more cleaner power. The sun can provide clean, non-polluting and sustainable electricity using solar panels. The use of 
    solar power has increased in recent years, see figure 1 (New York Times, 2024). However, the wide scale use of solar energy does 
    have some environmental problems too.

    Some of the raw materials needed to make solar panels include silicon, silver, and aluminium. Getting large quantities of silicon 
    dioxide is difficult as the mineral is found mostly in mines and the miners have a high chance of getting silicosis 
    (Rahman, A et al., 2022). Mining involves destroying large areas, which destroy natural habitats for both plants and animals. 
    Removing plant life can result in soil erosion, which decreases soil fertility and makes land worst for agriculture. It can also 
    create soil-heavy water that can flow downstream and lead to the buildup of heavy layers of sediment that may block streams or 
    rivers which can lead to flooding (Sulaeman et al. 2020). During heavy rain, the loose soil from mining sites gets washed away, 
    which will carry sediments into nearby streams, lakes, and rivers, this harms aquatic life and makes water unsafe for people to 
    drink (Anderson engineering company inc.).

    After the raw materials are mined, they need to be manufactured into solar panels. This process requires large furnaces which
    need a massive amount of energy to keep them hot and most of the energy needed to prepare pure silicon comes from power stations 
    burning fossil fuels (Breeze, 2016). Toxic materials are made as a byproduct such as silicon tetrachloride, which can be recycled 
    to create more polysilicon, however this is costly, so it is frequently left water or soil which results in contamination 
    (Rahman, A et al.). Hydrofluoric acid which is a toxic chemical is also used (Saltworks 2024). It needs to be handled with great 
    care otherwise it can leak into the environment, harming wildlife. With all the possible toxic chemicals that can be made during 
    the manufacturing process, factories must have systems in place to prevent accidents, however in many cases these safeguards are 
    not followed, leading to environmental damage.

    Solar farms, which are a large collection of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels used to produce electricity on a large scale, require 
    a lot of land. Estimates for utility-scale PV system range from 3.5 to 10 acres per megawatt (UCSUSA, 2013).  This can destroy 
    the natural habitats of species, for example in the Mojave Desert of California, tutorises have to dig burrows for their shelter 
    which other species also use (Rahman, A et al., 2022). Solar farms can also cause a phenomenon known as the photovoltaic heat 
    island effect, which occurs when solar panels reflect heat. Findings demonstrated that temperatures around a solar power plant 
    were 3-4°C warmer than nearby wildlands (Binder 2016). This alters the natural habitat and when animals are displaced from their 
    natural homes, they are often unable to adapt to the surrounding ecosystem, decreasing biodiversity.

    The effects of many of these issues can be reduced through better practices. For example, in the manufacturing process it is 
    possible to use renewable energy for the furnaces. Instead of building solar farms in natural habitats, it is possible to 
    prioritize building them in former industrial sites, degraded areas, abandoned agricultural lands or even in the roofs of houses, 
    this can preserve wildlife and keep biodiversity. It is possible to implement creative plans such as agrivoltaics, which is 
    agricultural production underneath solar panels (Widmer et al., 2024), this can fix the problems of solar panels taking up land 
    and impacting wildlife.

    As the world is increasingly getting warmer as the years go by, it is vital that we reduce the need to burn fossils and rely only 
    on renewable sources such as solar power to power our world. However, the world cannot simply just build more solar panels without 
    looking at the potential problems that may occur, but by carrying out stricter environmental rules and regulations for mining, 
    manufacturing, recycling and by investing more into sustainable designs and materials for solar panels, the world can maximize the 
    full potential of solar power whilst also protecting the planet.
